Version 0.9.16: This is a major upgrade of giv with the following new
futures:

* Floating point, 16-bit images, and 32-bit images are now supported.
* Added a color bar widget that is shown for high bit rate images.
* Created a plugin structure for external loaders.
* Includes loaders for the npy-format, FITS-format, and a simple DICOM 
  reader.
* A new contrast tool has been written that allows interactively changing
  contrast and brightness.

Version 0.9.12 : Added alpha support by adding a trailing /alpha after
the color name. E.g. "red/0.5" 


Version 0.9.10 : Interactive quiver zoom has now been implemented. To
a quiver arrowto a datapoint, use the "Q dx dy" privitive. E.g. if a
point at 100,100 has a quiver vector of 0.1 use the following syntax:

    100 100
    Q 0.1 0.1

The original scale of the quiver plot is determined by the $quiver_scale
keyword. The color of the quiver arrow is set by $quiver_color. 

When the data is viewed the scaling of the quiver arrows may be changed 
interactively by using pressing Shift+Scroll Wheel.

See the example examples/quiver.giv for an example.
