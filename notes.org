** Maemo installation
  - Don't install "complex plugins".
  - libpcre3 dependancy.
  - Have to get around vala and gob2 dependancy by adding generated files to git!
  - autoconf is badly broken.
  - Created if's in scons to not run vala or gob2 in sbox.
  - Optify requires:
#+begin_src sh
 cd /usr/lib
 ln -s /opt/maemo/usr/lib/libgiv-image.so 
 cd /usr/bin
 ln -s /opt/maemo/usr/bin/giv
#+end_src

** Async commands
   - Something is wrong with async communication as there is no handle to the query but only to the server. What if there are several queries done simultanously. How would the server differentiate between them?
